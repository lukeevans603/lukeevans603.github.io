## Biography

Dr. Luke J. Evans is a conservation ecologist whose work bridges quantitative modelling, remote sensing and field ecology. At the USGS/University of Florida’s Wetland and Coastal Ecology Unit he develops decision‑support tools to conserve shorebird nesting and migratory habitats and assesses the impacts of translocation on crocodilian populations. In parallel, he holds a postdoctoral appointment at the University of Florida’s Biodiversity & Conservation Lab, where he builds remote‑sensing metrics and species‑risk frameworks to inform conservation decisions.

Before joining UF, Dr. Evans held postdoctoral research positions at Arizona State University and at Stanford University with Cardiff University. His projects ranged from developing remote‑sensing biodiversity metrics to inform global species‑risk frameworks to leading work that helped establish a 400,000‑ha protected area in Malaysian Borneo. He has also served as technical manager of an environmental technology start‑up and managed crocodile conservation programmes.

Dr. Evans earned his PhD, MRes and BSc degrees in biodiversity conservation and zoology at Cardiff University, where he used remote sensing to explore how forest loss influences reptile behaviour and habitat quality. He has authored high‑impact papers in journals including *Trends in Ecology & Evolution*, *Journal of Biogeography*, *Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment* and *Global Ecology & Biogeography*. Google Scholar lists more than 660 citations and an h‑index of 13 for his work.

## Research Interests

* Quantitative ecology, decision theory and structured decision‑making.
* Remote sensing and spatial ecology, including LiDAR and satellite imagery.
* Biodiversity monitoring, invasion biology and conservation planning.
* Developing accessible decision‑support tools for managers and the public.

## Selected Publications

A selection of Dr. Evans’ recent publications includes:

* *Integrating remote sensing into species conservation* – *Trends in Ecology & Evolution*.
* *Remote sensing of habitat connectivity for reptiles* – *Journal of Biogeography*.
* *Decision‑support tools for invasive species management* – *Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment*.

## Teaching & Mentorship

Dr. Evans teaches courses on quantitative and spatial ecology, invasion science and remote sensing. He regularly delivers workshops on R programming, data analysis and remote sensing, has led more than 80 field courses on ecological field skills, and has supervised 2 PhD students, 3 masters students and over 30 undergraduate researchers.
