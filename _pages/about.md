Iâ€™m Dr. Luke Evans, an ecologist and conservation scientist focused on applying quantitative tools to real-world biodiversity challenges. My work spans from modeling translocation effects on American crocodile populations to building decision support tools for invasive species management.

I currently serve as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of Florida, where I apply structured decision-making to improve conservation outcomes for shorebirds and crocodilians in Florida. Previously, I held research appointments at Stanford, Arizona State, and Cardiff University, contributing to projects involving LiDAR-based biodiversity mapping, habitat connectivity, and wildlife conservation in Malaysian Borneo.

My expertise lies at the intersection of conservation planning, remote sensing, and quantitative ecology, and I'm passionate about translating complex science into actionable outcomes.
